Java 9 Collection library includes static factory methods for List, Set and Map interface. 
These methods are useful to create small number of collection.


Ex- List.of("one","two","three")

Java 9 Set Interface
Java Set interface provides a Set.of() static factory method which is used to create immutable set. 
The set instance created by this method has the following characteristcis.

It is immutable
No null elements
It is serializable if all elements are serializable.
No duplicate elements.
The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.

Java 9 Map Interface Factory Methods
In Java 9, Map includes Map.of() and Map.ofEntries() static factory methods that provide a convenient way 
to create immutable maps.

Map created by these methods has the following characteristics.

It is immutable
It does not allow null keys and values
It is serializable if all keys and values are serializable
It rejects duplicate keys at creation time
The iteration order of mappings is unspecified and is subject to change.
