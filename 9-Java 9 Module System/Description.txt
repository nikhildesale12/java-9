Java Module System is a major change in Java 9 version. 
Java added this feature to collect Java packages and code into a single unit called module.

In earlier versions of Java, there was no concept of module to create modular Java applications, 
that why size of application increased and difficult to move around. Even JDK itself was too heavy in size, 
in Java 8, rt.jar file size is around 64MB.

To deal with situation, Java 9 restructured JDK into set of modules so that we can use only required module for our project.
