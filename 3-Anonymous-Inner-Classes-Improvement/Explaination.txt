Diamond syntax, sometimes known as the diamond operator, 
It was added to Java 7 as just a new feature. The diamond operator makes it easier to employ generics while 
building an object.


Java 9 introduced a new feature that allows us to use diamond operator with anonymous classes. 
Using the diamond with anonymous classes was not allowed in Java 7.


Data types that can be written in Java program like int, String etc are called denotable types. 
Java 9 compiler is enough smart and now can infer type.
