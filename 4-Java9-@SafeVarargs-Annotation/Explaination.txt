It is an annotation which applies on a method or constructor that takes varargs parameters. 
It is used to ensure that the method does not perform unsafe operations on its varargs parameters.


It was included in Java7 and can only be applied on-
Final methods
Static methods
Constructors


From Java 9, it can also be used with private instance methods.
