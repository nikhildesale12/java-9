Java has improved its process API in Java 9 version that helps to manage and control operating system processes.

In earlier versions, it was complex to manage and control operating system processes by using Java programming. 
Now, new classes and interfaces are added to perform this task.

New interfaces ProcessHandle and ProcessHandle.Info are added.

Java ProcessHandle Interface
ProcessHandle helps to handle and control processes. We can monitor processes, list its children, get information etc.

This interface contains static factory methods that return instances that are value-based, immutable and thread-safe.
